# Kopas-RoboterControll
some school project

this is part of my school lessons from Dr. Kopas one of my programming teachers. 

The goal of this project is to controll a roboter with a rest api fully programmed in python. 

I used tkinter for the gui and flask for the rest api. 

## to get started

1. clone / download the project 
2. run server.py with python3 server.py
3. run client.py with python3 client.py
